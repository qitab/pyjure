;; This pass will
;; * identify for each scope (function or class)
;;  and each variables which is its scoping status:
;;  one of param, local, nonlocal, global.
;;  Issue an error if a variable has conflicting referents.
;; * detect which functions are generators
;;  (a yield statement taints the function even if it's going to be optimized away later)

;; * TODO distinguish module, class and def contexts, and only allow yield and return in def context.
;; * TODO? if we allow for lexical macros, these passes must be merged.
;; * TODO? detect other syntactically present side-effects in the function
;;  (e.g. pyjure rule definition, incremental class definition, etc.)
;;
;; Invariant: if the pass returns without an error, only metadata is changed.
;;
;; Information is stored in metadata for the function or class node.
;; further passes must be careful to NOT blindly copy that meta-data,
;; but only the meta data they know they preserve... ahem.
;; TODO: maybe store analysis in another field?

;; The analysis state is a map with keys :vars and :generators
;; :generators is a boolean telling if :yield or :yield-from is seen within that scope,
;; which will mark it as a generator (even if the statement is unreachable, e.g. after a return).
;; vars maps each variable name to a map with keys :locality :bound? :referred?
;; locality can be :param, :local, :nonlocal, :global
;; bound? can be nil (never bound) or true (bound at some point)
;; referred? can be nil (never referred) or true (referred at some point)
;; referred includes read or unbound.
;;
;; Flow control within a scope is not respected in this phase,
;; so we can't tell whether a variable is bound before it's read.
;; But we can tell that an attempt was made to bind a nonlocal or global variable,
;; or that conflicting locality declarations were made,
;; or that a variable is read but never bound.
